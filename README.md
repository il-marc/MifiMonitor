MifiMonitor
===========

Chrome extension for Mifi Monitoring

This Chrome Extension was developed after frustruation with the built web status screen on my Mifi2200 from Verizon

Install it, and when connected to a Mifi, you will track sessions and have a bandwidth graph!

~~No password required: This extension is read only, and cannot make changes to your configuration. It only reads status.~~

Password required for reconnection. But it still don't make changes to configuration.
